# Sharing your PrequelBot
So, you have tried [WarpChase](https://prequel-lang.org/examples/warpchase/), played it on your own or maybe with relatives/friends on the same device, learned from existing PrequelBot examples you could load from GitHub directly on the game website, and tentatively developed your bot up to a point where you believe others (like you in the past) could benefit from it.
What now?

Well, the following steps allow you to spontaneously create PrequelBots and see your changes reflected on the game website, no questions asked.

## #1 Sign up for a GitHub account
If you do not already have one, sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com).

## #2 Fork the prequel-bots repository
Go to [this repository](https://github.com/prequel-lang/prequel-bots) and click Fork, in the top-right corner of the page.

## #3 Create a file in /warpchase/
Place your bot code in a file with extension ".pre", inside a directory named "warpchase".
You can have more than one bot, each in a separate file.
[See an example here.](https://github.com/simoesh/prequel-bots/tree/main/warpchase)

## That's it!
You have done your part.
Now just sit back and relax while an automated script finds your source code, confirms that your repository has a known valid license, and checks that your PrequelBot manages to win one of up to three WarpChase matches against two [RandomBots](https://github.com/prequel-lang/prequel-examples/blob/master/src/warpchase/warpchase-random.pre).
This script usually takes less than an hour to complete.

Note that at any time you can remove PrequelBots from your repository and see those changes as easily reflected on the game website.

Thank you for being part of this community and contributing to better PrequelBots.
Enjoy!
